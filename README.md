# FolderToCloud

This application will aid you in to creating symbolic links. For more info about symbolic links: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa365680%28v=vs.85%29.aspx

These links are very helpfull to help back up certain folders. E.g. having your saved games automatically sync'd to Dropbox without having the trouble of copy-pasting after every game session.
